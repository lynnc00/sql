**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous work, I focused on utilizing SQL to clean up, aggregate and rearrange datasets to calculate different metrics, including product categories, vendor information and sales amount etc.. My primary goal is to improve the efficiency to obtain the results that match the optimal needs, and further integral and optimize the approach.

In consideration of data ethics, there might exits some gaps in the lack of data privacy and security. For all the data used in our project, it’s critical to ensure the confidentiality of personal information and prevent any data leaks from owned system or any third party.  Also, the potential bias in data entry and algorithms can lead to unfair and inaccurate outcomes, which result in inequalities.

To include ethics and inequity components, I will incorporate an updated approach that integrates ethics and equity into every step of my project. First, I will add correct data privacy and security protocols to protect user information, and ensure the data transparency during all the process of data collection and storage. Meanwhile, I will send the agreement to users to make sure they’re aligned with used information. On the other hand, I’ll implement diverse and representative data sets to train models and create regular audits of algorithms to evaluate and avoid bias, to ensure outcomes are unbiased. Establish clear legal guidelines and ethical policies for all stakeholders to align project privacy standards and include diverse groups to engage during the decision-making process to cover the impact of inclusive voices. By interrupting those adjustments, I can conduct more fair, ethical, and inclusive solutions to enhance the data quality and outcomes.
